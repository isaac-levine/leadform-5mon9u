# AI-Driven Lead Capture & SMS Platform Web Application

Enterprise-grade Next.js application for form building, SMS conversation management, and analytics with comprehensive security and performance optimizations.

## Project Overview

### Architecture
- Next.js 14 with React 18 and TypeScript
- Material UI v5 for enterprise-ready components
- Redux for state management
- WebSocket for real-time communications
- Enterprise-grade security implementations

### Key Features
- Dynamic form builder with real-time preview
- AI-powered SMS conversation management
- Real-time analytics dashboard
- Role-based access control
- Enterprise security standards compliance
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- npm >= 9.0.0
- Git (latest version)
- Docker (latest stable)
- VS Code with recommended extensions
- Security scanning tools

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd src/web
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Required environment variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Backend API endpoint
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL`: WebSocket endpoint
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Authentication callback URL
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: JWT signing secret
- `SENTRY_DSN`: Error tracking
- `DATADOG_API_KEY`: Monitoring
- `SMS_PROVIDER_API_KEY`: SMS service integration

### Development Scripts

```bash
# Development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Production server
npm run start

# Linting
npm run lint

# Unit tests with coverage
npm run test

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Security audit
npm run security:audit
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Strict TypeScript usage
- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Component-Driven Development
- Atomic Design principles
- SOLID principles adherence

### Testing Requirements
- Unit test coverage > 80%
- E2E testing for critical paths
- Performance testing
- Security testing
- Accessibility testing (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Security Considerations
- Regular dependency audits
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Secure authentication flows
- API key rotation
- XSS/CSRF protection
- Rate limiting implementation

## Deployment

### Build Process
1. Security audit
2. Dependency optimization
3. Code minification
4. Asset optimization
5. Performance benchmarking

### Environment Configurations
- Development: Hot reloading, debugging tools
- Staging: Production-like with monitoring
- Production: Optimized with full security

### Performance Targets
- Lighthouse Score > 90
- First Contentful Paint < 1s
- Time to Interactive < 2s
- API Response Time < 100ms
